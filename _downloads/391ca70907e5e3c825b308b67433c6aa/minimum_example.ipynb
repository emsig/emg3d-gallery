        "\n# 01. Minimum working example\n\nThis is a simple minimum working example to use the multigrid solver `emg3d`,\nalong the lines of the one provided in the manual as [\"Basic Example\"](https://emg3d.emsig.xyz/en/stable/manual/usage.html). To see some\nmore realistic computations have a look at the other examples in this gallery.\nIn particularly at `sphx_glr_gallery_tutorials_simulation.py` to see how\nto use `emg3d` for a complex survey with many sources and frequencies.\n\nAn absolutely minimal example, which only requires ``emg3d`` (with its hard\ndependencies ``numba`` and ``scipy``), is given here:\n\n```python\n# ======================================================================= #\n\nimport emg3d\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Create a simple grid, 64x64x64 cell, 100x100x100 m each.\nhx = np.ones(64)*100\ngrid = emg3d.TensorMesh(h=[hx, hx, hx], origin=(-3200, -3200, -3200))\n\n# Fullspace model with tri-axial resistivities (Ohm.m).\nmodel = emg3d.Model(grid=grid, property_x=1.5, property_y=1.8,\n                    property_z=3.3, mapping='Resistivity')\n\n# The source is an x-directed, horizontal dipole at the origin.\nsource = emg3d.TxElectricDipole(coordinates=(4, 4, 4, 0, 0))\n\n# Compute the electric signal for frequency = 10 Hz.\nefield = emg3d.solve_source(model, source, frequency=10, verb=4)\n\n# ======================================================================= #\n```\nHowever, above example is probably most useful on a server environment, where\nyou only want to solve the system, without any interaction. The example that\nfollows uses advanced tools of gridding including plotting, for which you need\nto install additionally the packages ``discretize`` and ``matplotlib``. Let's\nstart by loading the required modules:\n"

On the other hand, its boundary\nhas to be far away to avoid effects from the boundary condition. And then it\nshould need as few cells as possible for fast computation.\n\nYou can define your grid in any way that suits you, and there are better\ngrid-building tools than emg3d.
