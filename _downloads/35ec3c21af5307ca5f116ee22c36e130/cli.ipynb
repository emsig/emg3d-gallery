        "\n# 07. Command-line interface\n\nThe implemented command-line interface (CLI) can be powerful to use `emg3d`\nfrom any programming environment. It enables, for instance, to use `emg3d` as a\nforward modelling kernel in your inversion code running on a server. The\ncapabilities of the CLI are more limited than of the Python interface, but they\nare sufficient to compute the responses of a given `survey` for a provided\n`model`, and to compute the gradient of the misfit function.\n\nThe biggest difficulty to work with the CLI is, at the moment, the file\nformats, or better the lack of their documentation. Surveys, models, and grids\ncan be stored with `emg3d` to either h5, npz, or json files. The status of the\ndocumentation will improve towards the v1.0.0 release of `emg3d`. The \"easiest\"\nway at the moment is to generate such a file in Python, and reproduce its\nstructure in your language or program of choice. Please feel free to open an\nissue on GitHub if there are questions in this regard. The idea for the future\nis to go through https://github.com/softwareunderground/subsurface to interface\nto various file formats.\n"
